/* Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.). 

In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

The four links states are:

a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

see: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp 

The text-decoration property is mostly used to remove underlines from links.

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

*Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
*Style visited and unvisited links differently
*Style an element when it gets focus
*Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements
