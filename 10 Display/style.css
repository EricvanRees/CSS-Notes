/* The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex. 

see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display 

By default, block level elements have a 100% width property and stack on top of each other.

You can apply margin, border, and padding to block level elements. 

You cannot apply margins or height to inline elements. Padding works, but possibly overlaps with other elements. 

"display: inline-block" is for inline elements, which can now have the margin/border/padding properties of block level elements. This does not create a new line.

"display: inline-block" is used for styling links as buttons and turning a list into a row.

margin-inline: The margin-inline CSS shorthand property is a shorthand property that defines both the logical inline start and end margins of an element, which maps to physical margins depending on the element's writing mode, directionality, and text orientation.
