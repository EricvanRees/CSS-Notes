/*  HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.

For more information, see: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp 

An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.

An RGBA color value is an extension of RGB with an Alpha channel (opacity).

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness:

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

HTML supports 140 standard color names.
